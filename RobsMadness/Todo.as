/*

- fix rune scroll status effect sync (maybe fixed?)
- Fix 3 base classes not having ability icons
- buff paladins (add attack arc?) 
(Xeon: Add a charge attack, maybe enemies in front of the paladin take damage and are pushed back? Kinda like a slam attack)
-  + DONE undead shouldn't get holy auras/status effects
- dead players shouldn't be affected by scrolls
- make help window for each class
- Chaos runes eventually
- Decay rune destroying blocks
- Fire rune blowing up

- Standardize mana bar size
-  + DONE Fix RuneScribe GUI showing up when any menu is open, not just inventory.
- Add a button to each Touch/Sight rune to toggle between team and enemy
- Fix all the guis
-  + DONE (Might need to tag animals with the tag "animal") Animals shouldn't be affected by curse blocks
- Make Builder's worth going to over Runemasters. 
Perhaps highly increased gathering, access to mechanisms, 
remove/limit access to construction from rune master or cheaper construction??
